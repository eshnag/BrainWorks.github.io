    <h2 style="text-align: center">Guide To Enhancing E-Learning</h2>
    <h4>1. Constructivism<h4>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">The idea that people actively construct or make their own knowledge. An individual's reality is determined by their experiences as a learner. This is different from traditional teaching, because it allows for a more individual learning process and more creative freedom of the student. Provide information on concepts by instructions, but focus on the way the information is given rather than the content: 
</p> 
         <ul style="font-weight:normal">
           <li>Visual aids- our mind's preferred source of retaining and storing new information is by visual representation.
           </li>
           <li>Less time reading lectures, instead draw focus towards acting on the task at hand and giving full attention to that task.
           </li>
           <li>For information you want them to remember- drill it! The brain relies on familiarity and is comfortable using the knowledge that it is most used to. For certain information create tests, flashcards, and other memory tactics.</li> </ul>

     <h4>2. Multimodal Learning<h4>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">Learning delivered in image and sound. It can increase the brain's ability to change its behaviors and internal networks based on its external environment. <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#neuroplasticity" target="_blank">(neuroplasticity)</a></p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Several <a href = "https://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better" target="_blank">studies</a> prove that majority of the information processed by the brain is visual- thus educators must use online resources to create visuals that help learners process information quicker. As technology is advancing and our brains are adapting to certain online behaviors, it takes a toll on their cognitive load as information is getting thrown at us left and right. With visuals, the brain can easily attain certain information and better their comprehension.
           </p>
           <li>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">Make sure to implement a reward system.It's important to find balance between education and amusement without distractions. One way to ensure productivity and raise dopamine levels at the same time, is by rewarding the individual at the end of period of productivity or brain-engaging activity.
           </p>
           
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Case-Base: give examples on how the concept relates to the real-world by giving actual scenarios. When we envision ourselves in the situation and see how the information is applied in real life, we are more likely to gain interest and further pursue the topic.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">VARK Method: implement this tried and tested eLearning method which engages students in ways that they prefer, and that are beneficial to their cognitive load as well. V- Visual learning methods such as graphs and designs, which was previously discussed,is our brain's preferred way of attaining new information. A- Audio learning implementations such as ebooks and discussions engage the brain in a way other than simply reading the text across the page. 
             R- reading and writing techniques are for those who prefer jotting down notes and summaries on certain concepts. This can help drill concepts into the brain. Lastly, K- Kinesthetic learning is a "hands on" way of teaching which could be conducted through presentation projects, media productions, and other projects using online re-sources. These different methods all engage different regions of the brain, ensuring that we do not tire out a certain region and also keep the individual engaged, not distracted by other displayed information online.</p></li>
          </ul>

 <h4>3. Development of the Unconcious Mind<h4>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">Much of the cerebral cortex consists of “silent areas” that are not activated by sensory or motor activity. These silent, unconscious areas bring together higher cognitive functions that are not directly related to sensory or motor activity. Hence, it is extremely important to let the unconscious mind develop!
</p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Emotions called during learning and education affect the ways that an individual learns. This affects their understanding of their own ability to learn and their attitudes toward learning activities.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Emotion is a reaction to certain behaviors and events which generates unconscious responses. They are the unconscious perception of experiences and are not the product  of logic or reasoning.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">This unconscious process can lead to challenges in teaching, and the educators should allow the learners to become aware of their learning behavior and experience. 
           </p>
           </li>

           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Learning can be facilitated by connecting verbal and visual information, allowing the unconscious and conscious cognitive processes to form connections. So, the use of imagery and visuals in learning can make our conscious learning easier by passing complex information in an easily understandable format (visuals).

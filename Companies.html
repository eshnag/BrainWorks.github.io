    <h3>1. Cognitive Load</h3>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">Cognitive load is the term for the total amount of mental effort required and used in working our memory. The brain works with more concentration and less fatigue when we perform tasks that take up less cognitive loads. It is important for online services and features to minimize cognitive load and alllow users to perform tasks easily by utilizing their maximum mental ability. Some ways to improve user interface of your website:
</p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Use  standard design elements.</p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">The formatting and layout of your website should be easy to navigate. According to Jakob's Law of Internet User Experience, users spend most of their time on other websites. This means that familiarity and and the more experience a person has with similar navigation and web-design structure, the easier it is for them to identify similar structures on other websites. This reduces their cognitive load, as the amount of time recognizing  a like button similar to FaceBook's 'thumbs up' is much less than the time spent searching for an unknown icon/image.</p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">Similarly, use common icon labels. Use "contact", "sumbit", and "get started" rather than uncommon words to describe actions that the user takes. Again, an individual spends more time on other websites and platforms than yours, so ensure that the user has the most comfortable experience online and spends less time learning informarmation that is not important to the main goal of the page. This will lesson the cognitive load and allow them to navigate your site easily.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Don’t throw too much info at user at once.</p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">Requiring or prompting the user to perform multiple tasks online at once does not improve their ability to multitask. Multiple prompts ruins ability to focus on the task at hand. making the individual more likely to pay attention to the new distractions. This requires greater cognitive load from the brain and also diverges one's attention from the main goal of your website. When designing the platform, be sure to ask, "What is the main goal of this page?"</p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">One way to implement this is by avoiding multiple search features on same page- our brains don’t recognize the difference.</p></li>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Every link should have a certain action or task that needs to be completed. This will ensure that your website minimizes redundancies and engages the user properly.</p></li>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">Some examples of this are: </p>
           
           <ol>
             <li>Click email icon</li>
             <li>Click 'send to' and type input</li>
             <li>Type subject line in 'subject field'</li>
             <li>Type body of email in 'body' box</li>
             </ol>

           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Minimize motion- although we are primarily visual learners and learn better through imagery and videos, too much motion and animation on a different areas of the screen can overstimulate our brains. Try avoiding multiple pop-ups and animations. If needed, make the motion the main point or goal of the page.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Hick’s Law: The more options a user has, the more time they will take to make a decision. Lessen the amount of time required to complete a task or carry out the goal of the page, by reducing the amount of options the user has before they have to make a choice. For example, create umbrella categories like the ones on Amazon, for easier visual representation and organization of options.
           </p>
           </li>
           </ul>
</div>
<div class="mentalmod">
     <h3>2. Mental Models</h3>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">Each brain has its own ideas and representation on those ideas. Mental Models are clear examples which help people understand abstract concepts; they are what the user believes about the system, regardless of what the system teaches them. It's important to understand that each mind creates its own mental model, and that an online platform must modify its structure and design to adapt to each mental model.
</p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">These representations are based on the user’s own beliefs. <br> GOAL: make the user interface convey the program or system well enough such that users form accurate mental models and take the appropriate action.</p>
           <p>Each feature should be easy to understand to anyone's mental model.</p>
          <ol>
             <li> Hire a group of <a href="./beta.html" target="_blank">beta testers</a> to test out your website's features, and study what individuals prefer versus what confuses them online. </li>
             <li> Explain new and unknown content on a page early on so that users can navigate your system based on what they learned from the new information.
               <div style="font-weight:bold">
               <p>ONBOARDING: demo instructing user on website navigation. Ex: website tours, welcome tour, etc.</p>
          </div>
               Pinterest is an example of a website that does onboarding for new user. This helps the user familiarize themselves with the features of the webstie and develop mental models on what they can expect and how to use the features.

               <img id="pinterest" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c7fdbdd4e3feeee8dd96dd2/5d4dae372973ca0d860724ba_pin0.png" width="70%" style="padding:auto" alt="pinterestex">
               </a>
             </li>
          </ol>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">How do you introduce a new concept or feature without interferign with the user's mental model? You can organize the user interface according to the user's mental model. There are a couple ways to do this, but you can start by hiring a group of beta testers and using a Card Sorting Test to help determine which features of your system should be grouped together:
           </p>
           <div style="font-weight:bold">
           The Card Sort Test:
           <ol>
             <li>Gather a group of 10-15 testers</li>
             <li>Write the name of each feature/concept of your system, on separate cards.</li>
             <li>Shuffle the cards and hand them to the user altogether</li>
             <li>Ask each user to sort the cards into piles. They should place the cards that they believe belong together/in the same category, in same pile</li>
             <li>These piles will give you ideas for optimizing navigation links and labels.</li>     
          </ol>
          </div>
          <p>Each tester will have different piles, yet it is important to understand why they chose to put a certain feature in that pile. Questions to consider: Which pile matches the layout of the current system? What are the similarities between each user's pile?</p>
           </li>

           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Keep some elements consistent throughout the page, in order to match the 'general' mental model of the human brain:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Logos on upper left corner of page</li>
             <li>Changing color of visited links for easier navigation</li>
             <li>Opening hyperlinks in new tabs</li>
             <li>Headers in bold</li>
             <li>If used, breadcrumbs listed horizontally</li>  
             <a href="http://cssmenumaker.com/blog/fancy-breadcrumb-navigation-tutorial-example/" target="_blank">
             <img id="breadcrumbs" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/menumaker-blog/post_images/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-05-at-8.59.10-AM.png" width="70%" style="padding:auto">  
             </a>   
          </ul>
          Caution- features that cause confusion:
          <ul>
            <li>Main navigation/menu bar (left hand, horizontally laid, down the page, etc)</li>
            <li>Placement of search bar (usually goes on home page!)</li>
            <li>User log-in / signup</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <em>Again: Digital platforms and businesses should try to comply with common standards because users spend most of their time on other websites-

<div id="descriptions">
  <h1 style="text-align:center">CEREBRAL CORTEX:</h1>
  <h3>Largest part of our brain and is in charge of all our higher thinking and functioning. There are four main sections of the cerebral cortex: the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the temporal lobe.</h3>
<h1 id="prefrontal">The Frontal Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: PLANNING, ORGANIZING, PROBLEM SOLVING, ATTENTION, PERSONALITY, EMOTIONS, BEHAVIOR
</h6>
<p>You're frontal lobe is involved in the primary planning, control, and execution of all voluntary movements. It is in charge of your personality, emotions, and behavior as well as your ability to plan and problem solve. This large region is divided into three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Premotor Cortex: in charge of of sensory movememnt and control</li>
  <li>Supplementary Motor Area: plans movememnts and coordination</li>
  <li>Primary Motor Cortex: sends information down through your spinal cord in order to move different parts of the body.</li>
  </ul>
   <p>Object and face recognition are carried through in these visual areas. It holds the Semantic region of the brain which is resposible for grammar and language development as well.</p>

<h1 id="temporal-lobe">The Temporal Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: AUDO PROCESSING AND MEMORY FORMATION
</h6>
<p>The Temporal Lobe processes new information and stores it into our memories. It takes in our emotions and we use them to comprehend language, personality, human behvaior, and emotions. Here are more functins carried out in this region:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object and Face Recognition</li>
  <li>Sequencing</li>
  <li>Language and Speech Development</li>
  </ul>

  <h1 id="parietal-lobe">The Parietal Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: ACTIVATES OUR SENSES AND DISCERNS THE DIFFERENT SENSORY INFORMATION
</h6>
<p>The parietal Lobe receieves information from the outside world and uses our senses to analyze these information. It also uses our skin and nerves to detect senses.Here are more functins carried out in this region:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sense of Pain</li>
  <li>Interprets Visual and Motor Signals</li>
  </ul>

<h1 id="temporal-lobe">The Occipital Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: VISUAL PROCESSING
</h6>
<p>The Occiptal Lobe carries out visual perception and imagery in the brain. It is our most consious way of processing information and interprets vision, color, light and movement.</p>


<h1 style="text-align:center">LIMBIC SYSTEM:</h1>
  <h3>Involved in behaviors and emotional response. Found deeper in brain behind the cerebral cortex. Contains two major structures:</h3>

<h1 style="font-style: italic;">The Amygdala: </h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: PROCESSES EMOTION AND BEHAVIOR
</h6>
<p>"Processing center for fear‚Äù - MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences
</p>
<p>The Amygdala separates our good and bad feelings and emotions, and correlates certain emotions and experiences with memories as well. It processes fear before we become conscious of it or even recognize it. 
  For example, social media use, peer conformity, and acceptance of certain online behaviors may make young children vulnerable to fake news, self-expectations, and these unfavorable emotions.

  The Amygdala stores the memories associated with fear as well, so when a certain aspect of a product or system 'hurts' or negatively impacts the brain- high prices, for example- the amygdala stores this negative experience associated with this product.
</p>


<h1>The Hippocampus</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: HELPS ASSOCIATE MEMORIES WITH SENSE
</h6>
<p>The Hippocampus's function is important for forming new memories and allows us to learn new things.</p>
<p>It is how our brain is constantly changing its structure, an idea known as neuroplasticity.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><!--for explanations-->
<h1 id= "neuroplasticity" style="text-align: center">Why Does This Matter?</h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center"> It is important to understand the structure of the brain and how it works in order for us to implement digital techniques to improve the way technolgy shapes our brain. Companies and organizations rely on human interaction with their products and services in order to create profit, leave an impact, or whatever it is they aim to achieve. Our brain is constantly changing its structure and as we learn and acquire new information, and online learning and information displayed to us plays a key role in this development. In order for companies and educators to build their establishments and create a good standing online as well, the user interface of their systems must agree with the general function of the human brain. </h4>
<h4 style="font-style: italic">
  When all is said and done, the success of an individual or team relies on the cognitive understanding of our mind.</h4>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the way the brain is constantly reorganizing, developing, and changing itself according to your actions and environmental factors. What you think, feel, and behave like plays a huge rule in impacting your neuroplasticity and how your brain grows with you.</p>
<p>Ways our brain structure affects our online presense:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The majority of our decisions are made in the Limbic system, which makes decisions based on gut intuition rather than our logic. Our experience on online networks and websites are stored in our Limbic Brain which make these final decisions. Teams should look towards targeting the Limbic Brain in ways such as selling benefits not features, carrying a consistent theme, creating contrasts between similar systems, and more. (More on this here.)
  </li>
  <li>Cognitive Load is the total amount of mental effort used in working memory. Our brain works with more concentration and less fatigue when we perform tasks with less cognitive load. Online educators and companies should focus on reducing this cognitive load, and this can be done in several ways. (More on this here.)
  </li>
   <li>It is important to realize that each person has a seperate brain, and that our thoughts are unique to us. What is even more important to understand is how each mind has its own 'mental model': concrete examples that help the mind understand abstract concepts. They are what we believe about the system or product, before we explore and learn more about it.(More on this here.)
  </li>
<ul>
  </div><!--for background-->

  <p>Due to our brain's constantly changing behavior, it is important that digital media and networks alter their services in order to create and maintain a high quality user-product relationship. The first step to bridging the gap between online navigation and access and human brain is by simply learning the cognitive science behind it. </p>
